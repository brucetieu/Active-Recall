                        <em>"Active recall is the process of remembering information. It is an efficient way of moving information from short-term to long-term memory
                        so that you can easily draw on it again when you need it most, such as for an assessment or exam.
                        So the theory goes that if you want to remember a fact, don’t just read it, don’t reread it, don’t just underline or highlight it,
                        close your eyes and try to recall it without looking it up in your notes or online. If you can successfully do so, you have used active recall.
                            If not, look it up, learn it and then try again." </em>
